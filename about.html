			<p> Tyran't was formed in March 2022 when Aden Bellcock, Chris Pendleton, and Ethan Bellcock all crammed into Ethan's bedroom and played a terrible rendition of Metallica's "Enter Sandman" and "The Unforgiven". Just a few weeks later, the three of them were back at it with Metallica's "Nothing Else Matters" and Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". On August 3rd, 2022 Tyran't performed their first show at the Emerson in Bozeman Montana as part of a "Talent Show" for local musicians. They played a set composed of classic rock and metal hits such as AC/DC's "Thunderstruck", Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" and Metallica's "Fuel". They were joined onstage by Kasey Clements. Over the next few months, the trio honed their skills and brought on a new vocalist, Lou Norieka. This preparation accumulated into their award-winning performance at Belgrade High School's First Annual Battle of the Bands On March 31st, 2023. Tyran't received second place by a mere one point for their dynamics on stage and skill with each's chosen instrument. Tyran't plans to play multiple shows around the Gallatin Valley and beyond this fall and is currently in the concept phase of an EP, with a hopeful release date of Summer 2024.</p>

			<h2 id="Chris">Chris Pendleton</h2>
			<p>Born in Billings MT in 2006, Chris has gone on a musical journey in his few years. He grew up in Belgrade and learned piano as his first instrument. After he stopped taking lessons in piano, he took a few years before he started to play the guitar at age 13, learning primarily acoustic before diving into the intricacies of electric. Chris helped found Tyran't in 2022 with Ethan Bellcock and since has been a very active member of the band, helping plan shows and working on writing new material while also learning many covers. His primary inspirations come from bands such as Metallica, Foo Fighters, and Van Halen.</p>
