			<p> Tyran't was formed in March 2022 when Aden Bellcock, Chris Pendleton, and Ethan Bellcock all crammed into Ethan's bedroom and played a terrible rendition of Metallica's "Enter Sandman" and "The Unforgiven". Just a few weeks later, the three of them were back at it with Metallica's "Nothing Else Matters" and Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". On August 3rd, 2022 Tyran't performed their first show at the Emerson in Bozeman Montana as part of a "Talent Show" for local musicians. They played a set composed of classic rock and metal hits such as AC/DC's "Thunderstruck", Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" and Metallica's "Fuel". They were joined onstage by Kasey Clements. Over the next few months, the trio honed their skills and brought on a new vocalist, Lou Norieka. This preparation accumulated into their award-winning performance at Belgrade High School's First Annual Battle of the Bands On March 31st, 2023. Tyran't received second place by a mere one point for their dynamics on stage and skill with each's chosen instrument. Tyran't plans to play multiple shows around the Gallatin Valley and beyond this fall and is currently in the concept phase of an EP, with a hopeful release date of Summer 2024.</p>
